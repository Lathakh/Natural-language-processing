              "'I have three visions for India . In 3000 years of our history , people from all over the world have come and invaded us , captured our lands , conquered our minds . From Alexander onwards , the Greeks , the Turks , the Moguls , the Portuguese , the British , the French , the Dutch , all of them came and looted us , took over what was ours . Yet we have not done this to any other nation . We have not conquered anyone . We have not grabbed their land , their culture , their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them . Why ? Because we respect the freedom of others.That is why my first vision is that of freedom . I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857 , when we started the War of Independence . It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on . If we are not free , no one will respect us . My second vision for India ’ s development . For fifty years we have been a developing nation . It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation . We are among the top 5 nations of the world in terms of GDP . We have a 10 percent growth rate in most areas . Our poverty levels are falling . Our achievements are being globally recognised today . Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation , self-reliant and self-assured . Isn ’ t this incorrect ? I have a third vision . India must stand up to the world . Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world , no one will respect us . Only strength respects strength . We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power . Both must go hand-in-hand . My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds . Dr. Vikram Sarabhai of the Dept . of space , Professor Satish Dhawan , who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash , father of nuclear material . I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life . I see four milestones in my career'"
